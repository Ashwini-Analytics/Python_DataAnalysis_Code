# Iris Flowers Classiﬁcation 
 
 It have 5 instances among those 5 instances 4 are numeric. Each instance describes the properties of an observed ﬂower measurements and the output variable is speciﬁc iris species. The attributes for this dataset can be summarized as follows:
  - Sepal length in centimeters.
  - Sepal width in centimeters.
  -  Petal length in centimeters.
  - Petal width in centimeters.
  -  Class.
  
  This is a multiclass classiﬁcation problem, meaning that there are more than two classes to be predicted, in fact there are three ﬂower species
