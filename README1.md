# Hand Writing Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks

The MNIST problem is a dataset developed by Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes and Christopher Burges for evaluating machine learning models on the handwritten digit classiﬁcation problem. The dataset was constructed from a number of scanned document datasets available from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). 

 Each image is a 28×28 pixel square (784 pixels total). A standard split of the dataset is used to evaluate and compare models, where 60,000 images are used to train a model and a separate set of 10,000 images are used to test it. It is a digit recognition task. As such there are 10 digits (0 to 9) or 10 classes to predict. Results are reported using prediction error, which is nothing more than the inverted classiﬁcation accuracy. Excellent results achieve a prediction error of less than 1%. State-of-the-art prediction error of approximately 0.2% can be achieved with large Convolutional Neural Networks.
